Question 1:
----------

There is a file containing a word and its possible meanings (like a Dictionary). The contents of the file look like this:

# ------------------------------
Apple – a fruit, a tech firm

Table – an object, contains rows and columns when used in context of computers

Orange – a fruit
# ------------------------------

Given a path to the file, do the following:

a) Create a method called doesFileExist(String path) which takes the path of the file and tells the user if the file exists at that path or not. Assume all paths are relative to your project structure. If the file does not exist, catch the requisite exception.

b) Read each word and its possible meanings and print them out. Your output should look like this:

Word1

Meaning 1

Meaning 2

Word2

Meaning1

Meaning2

Using Java to run:
 
 Use `javac -d . WW/Filer.java 
` then `java Filer` to execute program. Input the file path of `./DictFile.txt`.



Question 2:
---------- 



Question 3:
---------- 
Generate 500 random numbers and create a method to print the nth smallest number in a programming language of your choice.

Using Java to run:
 
 Use `javac -d . WW/NthRandomNum.java 
` then `java NthRandomNum` to execute program. Input the kth smallest number and it will return that value.
